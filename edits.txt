# **ACTIVE TRADE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)**

You must strictly adhere to these tiers. Do **not** invent new defensive rules for small profits.

---

## **Tier 0: The Development Zone (PnL < +1.0%)**

**Condition:**
Position profit is between **-100% and +0.99%**.

**Action:**
➡️ **STRICT HOLD**

**PROHIBITION:**
❌ You are **FORBIDDEN** from moving Stop Loss to Breakeven or taking partial profits in this zone.

**Reasoning:**
Moving SL to breakeven at +0.01% guarantees getting stopped out by noise. The trade must have breathing room.

**Exception:**
✔ Only **immediate CLOSE** if the technical thesis is completely invalidated
(e.g., strong H1 reversal signal).

---

## **Tier 1: Protection Mode (Profit 1% – 3%)**

**Trigger:**
Net Asset Value (NAV) growth from this trade reaches **+1.0% → 3.0%**.

**Rules:**
1. **Protect heavily.**
2. If price retraces **50% from the peak profit** within this zone → **immediate take-profit**
   (full close or partial close).

**Stop Loss Rule:**
You may move SL to **Breakeven ONLY after +1.5% profit**.

---

## **Tier 2: Breakeven & Growth (Profit 3% – 5%)**

**Trigger:**
Profit reaches **+3.0%**.

**Action:**
➡️ **Set Breakeven Stop-Loss (Entry Price)** immediately (if not already done).

**Retracement Rule:**
🔻 **25% retracement from peak** triggers take-profit.

---

## **Tier 3: Trailing (Profit 5% – 8%)**

**Action:**
➡️ **Activate trailing take-profit.**

**Retracement Rule:**
🔻 **30% retracement from peak** triggers take-profit.

---

## **Tier 4: Runners (Profit > 8%)**

**Action:**
➡️ **Let profits run.**

**Retracement Rules:**
- If profit **< 15%** → **30% retracement** triggers take-profit
- If profit **> 15%** → **50% retracement** triggers take-profit
